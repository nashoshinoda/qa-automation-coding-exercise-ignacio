I included all the testable flows I designed in the test script in my repository mentioned at the bottom:
1. Validate the layout and the search items are displayed.
    * Go to the app.
    * Validate if the following items are displayed:
        * The header with the App title.
        * The search input field.
        * The Go button.
2. No repos found / no GitHub message(s):
    * Go to the app.
    * Type a random username.
    * Click the Go button.
    * Ensure the No GitHub message is displayed.
    * Ensure the message "No repos found" is displayed.
3. Validate the total number of repos matches with the repos listed.
    * Go to the app.
    * Type a valid username.
    * Click the Go button.
    * Ensure the total number of repos is printed.
    * Compare the total number of repos with the items listed in the table below.
